## New Feature Suggestions

### [ISSUE-C33] Beginner Glossary / Term Tooltip System
- **Source**: Competitor research (Investopedia 10K+ term glossary)
- **Priority**: P2
- **Effort**: 8-12h
- **Alignment**: Core value #4 "Point-to-point knowledge construction" + "Ten-second test"
- **Description**: The design system requires "All professional terms must have plain-language translations" but there's no systematic glossary. Beginners encounter terms like "ROE," "P/B ratio," "institutional investors" with no inline help.
- **Implementation**: Create `src/data/glossary.yaml` with term → plain-language definition. Add hover tooltips or click-to-expand definitions on all financial terms across all pages.
- **Competitive Gap**: 🟡 No TW competitor has systematic glossary tooltips

### [ISSUE-C34] Company Story Timeline (Narrative Thread)
- **Source**: Challenger review (Round 1) + competitor gap analysis
- **Priority**: P2
- **Effort**: 16-24h
- **Alignment**: Core value #1 "Story first, data second" + "Historian" positioning
- **Description**: The event dashboard is a disconnected list. What's missing is a narrative timeline — "Here's what happened to TSMC in the last 3 years, told as a story." The team has all the data (events, revenue, price) but no narrative thread connecting them. This is the #1 thing competitors DON'T have.
- **Implementation**: Add a "Story" tab to each company page that weaves events, revenue milestones, and price movements into a chronological narrative with plain-language explanations.
- **Competitive Gap**: 🔴 No competitor has narrative timeline — unique differentiator

### [ISSUE-C35] Market Mood Index
- **Source**: Competitor research (WantGoo market temperature, CMoney sentiment)
- **Priority**: P1 (conditional on data validation)
- **Effort**: 10-12h
- **Alignment**: Core value #3 "Adaptive and self-evolving" + beginner-friendly
- **Description**: Beginners want to know "Is the market hot or cold right now?" A simple market mood index on the homepage using institutional buy/sell surplus + trading volume + advance/decline ratio.
- **Data Feasibility**: FinMind has `TaiwanStockInstitutionalInvestorsBuySell` — validated
- **Competitive Gap**: 🟡 WantGoo has temperature but not explainable mood index

5. **C35 Market Mood** — Conditional on data validation

### Medium-Term (Post-Sprint 2)
6. **C33 Glossary** — Systematic educational infrastructure
7. **C14 Health Score** — Depends on Daniel's scope decision
